MVVM separates the user interface (View), data model (Model), and logical operations (ViewModel), making the code more organized and manageable.
Integration of Firestore Database:

It provides real-time data synchronization, allowing users to access up-to-date information instantly.
Firebase Authentication:

Users can log in using email/password, social media accounts, or other identity providers.
Usage of SwiftUI:

It is a modern declarative UI framework that facilitates rapid creation of user interfaces.
